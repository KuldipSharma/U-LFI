# U-LFI
Ultimate-LFI (Local File Inclusion) Scanner

*THE SCRIPT IS MADE WITH <3 in Python 3*

So, what the hack is A LFI. Lets see what wikipedia say-

File inclusion vulnerability is a type of vulnerability that is most commonly found to affect web applications that rely on a scripting run time. 
This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled variable in a way that allows the attacker to control which file is executed at run time. 
A file include vulnerability is distinct from a generic Directory Traversal Attack, in that directory traversal is a way of gaining unauthorized file system access, and a file inclusion vulnerability subverts how an application loads code for execution.
Successful exploitation of a file include vulnerability will result in remote code execution on the web server that runs the affected web application.

So to check your website for this vulnerability I made this simple script with Pyhthon3.
Module required for running the script is #BS4. To install the module-
Simply type this command- 
# apt-get install python3-bs4
or you can download it from this link- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4  MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAF FOR PYTHON 3.
